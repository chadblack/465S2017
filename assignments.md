* Quizzes: 30% (ten quizzes, three points each)
* Exam I Essay: 20%
* Historiography Paper: 25%
* Final Malintzin Paper: 25%

All assignments will be graded on a letter-grade scale (A=4.0; A-=3.7; B+=3.3;
B=3.0; B-=2.7; and so on). This grading system corresponds
with the UT undergraduate catalog. Please consult it for clarification
(http://catalog.utk.edu/). The one exception to this scale are the quizzes,
which will be check-plus, check, minus (3,2,1 points). 

**Reading.** Each meeting's assignments must be completed before we meet.
Quizzes will be based on the assigned reading.

The bulk of the class grade comes from the **three papers**. Exam I is a
take-home essay based on a writing prompt. As with other papers, it must be
well argued and cite sources from assigned readings in the class. Students will
write a historiography paper (a review of the development of historical
literature) on a topic of their choosing related to the gender and sexuality in
colonial Latin America. Students must chose two books and five articles to use
for writing this paper. I will give specific guidance on where and how to
select these works. The final paper will be due during the exam period.
Students will write a critical analysis of the figure of La Malinche/Malintzin
based on what they've learned about the operation of gender and sexuality over
the course of the semester.

**Participation.** Learning is an interactive process and I strongly encourage
students to participate during both lectures and discussion by providing
comments and questions based on the readings for the week. We will regularly
devote class time to discussion of assigned readings (particularly primary
source readings), lectures, and film
