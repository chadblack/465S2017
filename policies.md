 Please note:  If any special accommodations are needed to complete the
 requirements of this course, please come see me at the beginning of the
 semester. No make-up exams or incompletes will be given without medical
 documentation. 

 Absences: Multiple absences from the class meetings will be noted and will
 affect a student’s participation grade.

 Deadlines: Assignments must be emailed to the instructor no later than the
 beginning of class on the day they are due, or at some other specified time
 established by the professor. It is important to be technologically savvy in
 today’s world. Much of our communication occurs through email, including the
 sharing of documents and other work product. Late papers will not be accepted
 for any reason without prior arrangement. This includes technology problems.
 You’re responsible for attaching your work correctly and sending it in on
 time.

 Cell Phones and Laptops: Please silence our cell phones prior to class.
 Please do not text during class. I’m not so vain as to think students are
 live twittering my compelling lectures, so leave the SMS for outside of
 class. Laptops are allowed only if students use them responsibly. In the case
 of our class, that means to access readings or to take notes. Anything else
 is inappropriate (emailing, facebook, etc.). If I find a student using a
 laptops for non-course related activities, that student will be asked to put
 the laptop away, and not bring it back to class. If this happens repeatedly,
 the rule will change to no laptops.
