Scholars and activists frequently claim that the current status of women in
Latin America stems from a colonial legacy of gender oppression and sexual
repression. And yet, the status of women has changed substantially, not always
for the better, since the colonial period. Similarly, sexuality in the colonial
period contradicts modern notions of an evolution of sexual constraints
constructed through public and private divisions of social space.  This course
examines the sources, methodologies, and theoretical approaches that shape the
history of women and sexuality in early Latin America. The readings represent
ethnic, racial, and class-based distinctions among women and emphasize the
importance of using diverse approaches in the reconstruction women’s history
and culture, particularly for indigenous and African women. The course ends
with an analysis of how female figures from the colonial period, such as La
Malinche and the Virgin of Guadalupe, have been incorporated into modern
political agendas by intellectuals and political activists. Students will read,
analyze, and discuss both primary and secondary sources to understand how
history is conceived and written.
